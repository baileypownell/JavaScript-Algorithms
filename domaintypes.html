<h2>GoDaddy makes a lot of different top-level domains available to its customers. A top-level domain is one that goes directly after the last dot. in the domain name, for example.com in example.com. To help the users choose from available gomains, GoDaddy is introducing a new feature that shows the type of the chosen top-level domain. You have to implement this feature. To begin with, you want to write a function that labels the domains as "commercial", "organization", "network", or "information" for .com, .org, .net, or .info respectively. For the given list of domains return the list of their labels.</h2>
