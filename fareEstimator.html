// Uber is building a Fare Estimator that can tell you how much your ride will cost before you request it. It works by passing approximated ride distance and ride time through this formula: Cost/minute * rideTime + Cost/mile * rideDistance where Cost/minute and Cost/mile depend on the car type. Knowing cost/mile for each car type, as well as ride distance and rideTime, return the fare estimates for all car types. Note: costPerMile and costPerMinute are related; if the costPerMinute is $0.35, then the costPerMile is $1.80.

function fareEstimator(rideTime, rideDistance, costPerMinute, costPerMile) {
  let price = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < costPerMile.length; i++) {
    let cost = Number(rideTime*costPerMinute[i] + rideDistance*costPerMile[i]).toFixed(2);
    price.push(' ' + cost);
  }
  console.log('Your possible prices are:' + price  + ' dollars');
}

fareEstimator(30, 7, [.2, .35, .4, .45], [1.1, 1.8, 2.3, 3.5]);
