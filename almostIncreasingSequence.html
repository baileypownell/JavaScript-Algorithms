// Objective: Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and determines whther is is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing NO MORE than one element from the array. So for example, [2, 4, 3] would be an almost increasing sequence because you only have to remove one number, the three, for it to be increasing in value with each element

let array = [12, 17, 15];

function almostIncreasingSequence(array) {
  // assign variables to count value differences between adjacent elements, and to count how many times a differences in values is less than 0 (our criteria will allow for only one difference less than zero, because the number giving us a negative difference can be removed to make the array increasing. However, if there are two negative differences, we'd have to remove two elements, and that is not allowed)
  let difference = 0;
  let numberOfDifferences = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    difference = array[i + 1] - array[i];
    if (difference < 0) {
      numberOfDifferences++;
    }
