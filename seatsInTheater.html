// Your frind advised you to see a new performance in the most popular theater in the city. He knows a lot about art and his advice is usually good, but not this time. It's so bad you want to sneak out, which is quite simple, especially since the exit is located right behind your rwo to the left.
// Given the total number of rows and columns in the theater (nRows and nCols, respectively), and the row and column you're sitting in, return the number of people who sit strictly behind you and in your column or to the left, assuming all seats are occupied. Do not count the row you are sitting in.
