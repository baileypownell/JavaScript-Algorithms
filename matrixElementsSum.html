// A hotel's rooms are represented by a multi-dimensional array. Each room is represented by a cell which contains an integer, the price of the room. Free rooms cost 0, but that is because they are haunted. Any room that is free/haunted or is at any point located below a free/haunted room in the same column is not viable. Calculate the total price of all available rooms.
