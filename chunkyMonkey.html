// Objective: Write a function that splits an array (first argument) into groups the length of size (second argument) and returns them as a two dimensional array. If there are leftovers from splitting, but them in their own array. It is a given that the first array's length exceeds the length of size (second argument).

  }
  console.log(newArray);
