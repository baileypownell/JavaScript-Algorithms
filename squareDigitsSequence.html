// Consider a sequence of number a0, a1, etc. inwhich an element is equal to the sum of squared digits of the previous element. The sequence ends once an element that has already been in the sequence appears again. Given the first element a0, find the length of the sequence. For example, a0 = 16, the output should be 9 because it takes 9 iterations to get to 16 again. The first iteration for 16 would be 1^2 = 6^2 = 37.
